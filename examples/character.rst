Character Example
===========================================

In this example, the basic usage of the Logic Node System is explained.

We will use the Cube from the default startup file as the character. 
For this, select the cube and set its physics to "Character".

Now we need to apply logic to the cube. This can be achieved via various methods.

1) Logic Bricks
2) Python Scripts
3) Logic Nodes (only available if the Add-On is active)
